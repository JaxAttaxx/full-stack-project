Team-Me is an application for managing multiple teams and multiple players. With Team-Me you'll be able to manage which players are
on your team, as well as the roles they will be playing. Players will be able to log in and see what roles they are given in advance of
any competition. Verified players will also be able to be a part of many different teams at the same time.
